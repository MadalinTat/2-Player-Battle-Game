# 2-Player-Battle-Game
A simple battle game for 2 players where you create your characters, roll the dice, and battle!

The characters:

- Input the name;
- Health and Strength randomly generated;
- The attack is the difference of both characters's strength + 1.

Player 1 and Player 2:

- Chose your character's name!
- Wait for the dices to roll to see who will strike first!
- Stay and witness your characters battling until one of them dies!

About the battling system:
- A function that rolls two 6 sided dices, one for Player 1, one for Player 2. Who's value is greater gets the chance to strike (A player has the chance to strike every time in all the rounds if he is "lucky").
- A strike represents a round. In the next roud, if both players are alive, the action repeats until you reach the round where one of the characters's health is 0 or below.
